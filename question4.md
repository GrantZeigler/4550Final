<p>The definition of software metrics is: "How well software satisfies its functional and non-functional requirements." This essentially means "can a program do what it is supposed to do, and how efficiently does it"</p>
<p>They measure a few different statistics about programs. These statistics are used to determine some characteristics of the program. These characteristics are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Functional Suitability</li>
<li>Performance efficiency</li>
<li>Compatibility</li>
<li>Usability</li>
<li>Reliability</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Maintainability</li>
<li>Portability</li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose of software metrics is to give a concrete measurement to how efficient a system is. Analyzing the quality of the program and the its processes can be used to determine where the program can be improved.</p>
<p>Each metric's acceptable value depends on the program analyzed. Size Oriented Metrics are the most impacted by this. They are measured based off of Lines of Code. Some examples are errors/KLOC, or COST/LOC. Since the values of these grow as the project grows in size, the acceptable amount would have to grow with it. The acceptable value in this case is decided by the person or the people working on the software.</p>
